<h2>Aspiring Product Designer</h2>

<p>Joan graduated from Olin with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. She worked as a Manufacturing Eng. and then as an IT/Software Consultant. She is excited to finally get the opportunity to design a product the user wants to use, not just making minor tweaks to the existing system.</p>
